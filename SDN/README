SDN(Software Defined Network) is widely used to define the behavior of a switch in the network.
This lab construct following topology
        s3
      /    \
h1 - s1     s2 - h2
      \    /
        s4
And then do the following three questions:
1. Write a RYU controller that switches paths (h1-s1-s3-s2-h2 or h1-s1-s4-s2-h2) between h1 and h2 every 5 seconds. 
2. Write a RYU controller that uses both paths to forward packets from h1 to h2.
3. Write a RYU controller that uses the first path (h1-s1-s3-s2-h2) for routing packets 
   from h1 to h2 and uses the second path for backup. Specifically, when the first path experiences a link failure, 
   the network should automatically switch to the second path without causing packet drop. 
   (hint: consider using OFPGT_FF (FF is short for "fast failover") to construct a group table)

The third problem is so hard that I cannot figure it out yet.

About the file name:
Remote_control.py is the topology, it should be run on Mininet
simple_switch_13.py is the solution for question 1
sample.py is the solution for question 2
t4.py is a half-built program that still has ARP storm
